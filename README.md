## Features

- [x] Semantic highlighting.
  - Automatically detects whether a buffer language type can be highlighted.
  - Removes any default highlighter and replaces them with a tree-sitter based.
- [x] Semantic selections (types, functions, parameters, comments, tests, etc.)
  - Similar features to `f`, `?`, `<a-/>`, etc.
  - Full _object_ mode support (i.e. `<a-i>`, `{`, `<a-]>`, etc.)
- [ ] Indents
- [ ] Indent guidelines
- [ ] Incremental parsing
- [x] Fetch, compile and install grammars / queries with ease (via the use of the `ktsctl` controller companion)
- [x] Ships with no mappings, defined options, but allows to use well-crafted values, user-modes, mappings and
  commands by picking them by hand.
- [x] Transformation-oriented; actual data (i.e. grammars, queries, etc.) can be used from any sources.

## Usage

## Alternatives
